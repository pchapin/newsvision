<p>This is the documentation for Jibber, a Java NNTP server. Jibber was
created to service lightly loaded, local access newsgroups. It is not
intended for use with a full (or even partial) "real" newsfeed. The idea
is to simplify a small organization's internal communication by allowing
people to use conventional news readers to read from and post to
internal discussion boards.</p>
