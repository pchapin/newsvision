This is a Win32 application that can read/write the Pegasus noticeboards.
It was created back when Pegasus Mail was the official mail program at VTC
and when the college was using the Pegasus noticeboards for internal
forums. When the mail system was changed to a different mail program (was
it Mulberry?), there was a desire to continue using the same forums.
However, since the format of the Pegasus noticeboards was specific to
Pegasus Mail, it was necessary to reverse engineer that format and build a
new program that could handle it. The Computer Club took this on and nbread
(NoticeBoard READer) was the result.

This program was never actually deployed. By the time it was in a useable
state, an entirely different forum solution was found. However, it is
possible that this program could be updated to be an NNTP reader instead of
(or in addition to) the Pegasus noticeboard format. Other potential
applications could be imagined.
