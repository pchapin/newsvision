"Critical issues" in rough order of priority.

1. The fixed width font in the notice window should be something different than it currently is.

2. Window sizes and positions should be remembered in the .cfg file. When the program
   initializes it should restore the window size and positions to what they were when the
   program last exited.

3. When a notice is posted it should immediately appear in the list of notices for its topic and
   it should be marked as read.

4. Fixed width fonts in the posting dialog.

5. Supress extra headers.

6. The number of objects in each topic should be a new column in the list view.

7. The number of unread notices in such topic should be displayed in the list view.

Full issues list in no particular order.

+ It should be possible to insert a text file into a posting while the posting is being
  composed.

+ Selecting "Cancel" on the configuration dialog (when it appears at program start up) should
  gracefully exit the program.

+ There should be a proper icon in the upper left corner of the posting dialog box.

+ The close gadget on the posting dialog box should behave like "Cancel". Right now it does
  nothing.

+ Upgrade the handling of the NetWare API so that it uses non-obsolete functions and also
  doesn't rely on bindery emulation.

+ It should support the printing of notices.

+ There should not be any flickering when scrolling the notice window.

+ It should allow users to cut and paste text between the notice window and the clipboard.

+ The posting dialog should be such that the area for posting can be expanded.

+ Signature files should be supported.

+ The method for coming up with unique file names for new postings should be improved.

+ The subtopics should be displayed and navigated using a tree view control.

+ It should be possible to set fonts in the various windows.

+ Should there be a "wrap lines" option in the notice window?

+ The unimplemented menu items should be implemented.

+ It should be possible to configure notification for various noticeboards and not just a few of
  them.

+ nbread.hst should be read-only.

+ Allow the name and location of the history file to be configurable.

+ The checked and unchecked icons should look better.

+ The main nbread icon should look better.

+ Tabs should be expanded into spaces in the notice window.

+ It should list notice files that have no attributes set (and not just the 'A' attribute!).
  This appears to only be a problem under Windows NT.

+ When MDI child windows are closed and reopened, they should return to the size and position
  they had before.

+ When the topic or edit window is maximized, the min/max/close controls vanish.

+ It should support "horizontal" tiling of the MDI child windows.

+ The boundary between the subtopics and the notices in the topic window should be adjustable.

+ You should be able to select a notice by double clicking on any part of its row in the topic
  window. (The selection logic should also allow for easy stepping through the notices with the
  arrow keys).

+ Sorting should work. The user should be able to change the sort direction by clicking on the
  list view columns.

+ Add a toolbar for easy selection of certain options (next notice, post, etc).

+ Allow user to configure so that only certain topics are displayed.

+ Check for new notices periodically.

+ Support attachments.
