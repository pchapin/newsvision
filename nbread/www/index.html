    <h2>Overview and History</h2>

    <p>At the moment this project is just a place holder. The nbread project was originally done
    by the VTC Computer Club. It was to be our own reader for Pegasus Mail noticeboards. This
    was important at a time when VTC was using Pegasus Mail noticeboards for internal
    communication. Shortly after this project was finished, VTC abandonded the Pegasus
    noticeboards and so this program never saw much actual use. However, it could be generalized
    and extended by making it into a NNTP client as well. Such an extension could make it a
    useful complement to the <a href="http://vortex.cis.vtc.edu/pcc/prog/Jibber/">Jibber</a>
    project.</p>
