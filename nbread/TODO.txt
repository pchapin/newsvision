+ Numerous (minor?) bugs related, I suppose, to the multiple, partial ports of the program that
  have been done since its original creation. It would be good to set up a bug tracking system
  (Mantis?) to help manage the bugs for this project and any other project in a similar state.

+ Port to Open Watcom?

+ Create some unit tests.

+ Write some documentation.

+ Does it make sense to evolve this project into a general purpose newsreader? It could be cool
  to support both NNTP and local groups simultaneously.

+ The built-in editor is horrible. Surely there is something better that could be used.
